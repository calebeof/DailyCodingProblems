/*
This problem was asked by Alibaba.

Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.

A solution will always exist. See Goldbachâ€™s conjecture.

Example:

Input: 4
Output: 2 + 2 = 4
If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.

If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, then

[a, b] < [c, d]
If a < c OR a==c AND b < d.

EASY

After we generate primes with the Sieve of Eratosthenes, the problem become easy:
Just traverse the array of primes and check if n-primes[i] is prime. That can be checked in constant time.

Complexity: O(N*log(log(N))), where N is the number that we want the number that we want to find the two primes added up to N.
