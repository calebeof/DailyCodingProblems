This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a positive integer n, find the smallest number of squared integers which sum to n.

For example, given n = 13, return 2 since 13 = 32 + 22 = 9 + 4.

Given n = 27, return 3 since 27 = 32 + 32 + 32 = 9 + 9 + 9.

In this problem, a dinamic programming approach can be made if we test every single number i that (when it is squared) is 
smaller than N. So, we subtract N by (i*i) and continue the process until we fall to the base case N<=1, where we return N.
Then, it is returned the minimum steps required to get into the base case.

The recursion also can be:
f(N) = min(f(N-(i*i))), where i is [1, sqrt(N)],
f(N) = 0, where N = 0,
f(N) = 1, where N = 1,
f(N) = 2, where N = 2,
f(N) = 3, where N  = 3.

Complexity: O(NÂ²), where N is the number that we want to know.
